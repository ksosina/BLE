Baltimore City has a rich history of community organizing and civic engagement. On any given night, 
somewhere in the City a neighborhood group is meeting, discussing community concerns, planning for their 
collective future and advocating for action. BNIA-JFI currently tracks nine neighborhood and community 
indicators to measure the extent to which the Cityâ€™s neighborhoods are active, organized, and empowered. 
These include: the number of neighborhood associations and block groups; the number of Community Development 
Corporations (CDCs); the number of umbrella organizations; the number of park stewardship groups; the number 
of community gardens; Healthy Neighborhood Initiative locations; the number of historic properties; the 
percentage of the population registered to vote; and the percentage of persons voting.
